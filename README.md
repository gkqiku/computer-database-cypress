Cypress Installation and Execution Guide
This guide provides instructions on how to install Cypress and run tests for web applications.

Prerequisites
Before installing Cypress, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

Node.js: Cypress requires Node.js to run. Install Node.js if you haven't already. You can download it from Node.js website.
Installation

Initialize Your Project:

If you haven't already set up your project, navigate to your project directory and initialize a package.json file using the following command:

csharp

npm init -y
Install Cypress:

Use npm to install Cypress as a dev dependency:

npm install cypress --save-dev
Verify Installation:

After the installation, Cypress will create a folder structure for its tests. To verify that Cypress is installed correctly, run:

npx cypress --version
Running Cypress
To execute Cypress and run your tests, follow these steps:

Open Cypress:

To open the Cypress Test Runner, run the following command in your terminal:

arduino

npx cypress open
This will launch the Cypress Test Runner, and you will see the Cypress window with your project structure.

Run Tests:

In the Cypress Test Runner window, click on a spec file or test you want to run. Cypress will open a browser and execute the test, displaying the results within the Test Runner.

Writing Tests
Cypress tests are written in JavaScript and are stored within the cypress/integration directory. To create new tests or modify existing ones, simply add or edit the test files in this directory.

Refer to the Cypress documentation for detailed information on writing tests.

Cypress supports different browsers. You can configure which browser to use for testing within the Cypress Test Runner.
